# spring_getting_started
Test projekt for getting started with spring on 2. semester

After creating an empty new spring project in IntelliJ through the _Spring Initializer Template_     
(described here: [#4 Hello Spring](https://github.com/dat17v1/2_03_hello_spring)), you should now create your first website.

## Your First Website
You now have a folder and file structure that looks something like this:

If you open your src folder you will see a _main_ and a _test_ folder. Delete the test folder, and delete the mvnw and the mvnw.cmd files. (you could leave them in the project, but since we are not going to use them we delete them for a better overview)
