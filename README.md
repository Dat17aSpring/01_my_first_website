# spring_getting_started
Test projekt for getting started with spring on 2. semester

After creating an empty new spring project in IntelliJ through the _Spring Initializer Template_     
(described here: [#4 Hello Spring](https://github.com/dat17v1/2_03_hello_spring)), you should now create your first website.

## Your First Website
You now have a folder and file structure that looks something like this:

If you open your src folder you will see a _main_ and a _test_ folder. Delete the _test_ folder, and delete the _mvnw_ and the _mvnw.cmd_ files. <sup>(you could leave them in the project, but since we are not going to use them we delete them for a better overview)</sup>

Now you have a project structure that looks like this:

DonÂ´t be confused by all the folders. They are packages (or just folders) and is not specially important right now. You can for now see the _demo_ folder as your root folder.

## Create a normal java class file
In the demo folder create a class and call it HomeController.java.     
* Right click the "demo" folder
* chose: New -> Java Class  
* Name: HomeController
* Kind: Class

### Create an index method in the class
Create a public method called index with a return type of String, and return the string "index".

Add _@Controller_ above the class definition and _@GetMapping("/")_ above the method definition.
